update requirement.txt as required dependencies
Summary

    Updated requirements.txt to include missing runtime dependencies that are already referenced by the codebase: PyNaCl (for Phantom deep-link encryption utilities) and solana/solders (for Solana RPC + transaction construction paths).

    Kept the dependency list organized by adding a dedicated Solana Integration section and preserving existing package groups.

Testing

    ✅ pytest -q
