# 🏆 Hackathon Win Plan (Superteam Nepal Mini-Hack)

This playbook is optimized for judging criteria: clarity, impact, business case, UX, implementation quality, and completeness.

## 1) Submission Checklist (must-have)
- [ ] Public GitHub repo
- [ ] README with problem, solution, architecture, setup, and run instructions
- [ ] At least one local test command that passes
- [ ] Project description (short + long)
- [ ] Live link (if deployable in time)
- [ ] Demo video (optional but highly recommended)
- [ ] Team member names + roles

## 2) 24-hour Prioritization Strategy

### Tier 1 (Do first)
1. End-to-end happy path works reliably.
2. README is complete and easy for judges to run.
3. Demo script is rehearsed and under 90 seconds.

### Tier 2 (Do next)
1. Clean UX labels and flow for first-time users.
2. Add clear error states (wallet missing, bad image, API failures).
3. Add one impact metric slide (e.g., "KYC prep reduced from 20 min to 3 min").

### Tier 3 (If time remains)
1. Lightweight analytics/admin dashboard screenshots.
2. Extra form template(s).
3. Small growth angle (B2B SaaS pricing hypothesis).

## 3) Demo Video Shot List (45–75 sec)
1. **Hook (5 sec)**: "Manual document workflows are slow and forge-prone."
2. **Upload + extraction (10–15 sec)**.
3. **Human review/edit (8–12 sec)**.
4. **Generate PDF + on-chain anchor (10–15 sec)**.
5. **Verification screen (10–15 sec)**.
6. **Closing (5 sec)**: impact + target users.

## 4) Judge-facing Value Narrative
- **Problem clarity**: Explain the exact bottleneck in Nepal’s paperwork flows.
- **Impact**: Show saved time, reduced errors, and auditability benefits.
- **Business case**: Start with banks/cooperatives/insurance onboarding.
- **Technical quality**: AI extraction + deterministic hashing + Solana proof.
- **Completeness**: Working app + docs + short demo.

## 5) Social Post Templates

### X Post
> Built **FOMO** at Superteam Nepal University Tour 🚀  
> We convert paper-heavy document workflows into verifiable digital flows using AI + Solana proof-of-existence.  
> Upload → Extract → Review → Generate PDF → Verify On-Chain ✅  
> Repo: <github-link>  
> #Solana #BuildOnSolana #NepalTech #Superteam

### LinkedIn Post
> We built **FOMO**, an AI + Solana prototype for document automation and verification.  
> It helps teams extract data from IDs, auto-fill forms, and anchor proof metadata on Solana so documents can be verified later.  
> Why this matters: less manual work, fewer errors, and better trust in records.  
> GitHub: <github-link> | Demo: <demo-link>

## 6) Final Hour Before Submission
1. Freeze features.
2. Re-run app walkthrough once.
3. Re-run tests once.
4. Verify README setup steps from scratch.
5. Record demo in one clean take.
6. Publish social proof post.

## 7) Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Over-explaining architecture but not showing working flow.
- Missing setup steps or broken install command.
- Demo longer than 2 minutes.
- No clear target user / business path.
- Submitting without team roles and clear ownership.
